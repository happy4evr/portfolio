                                   Throughout the field trips I have attended, one that stood out the most was my trip to 
                                   SAP which was quite intriguing in terms other employees sharing their experience towards becomes successful in life. While 
                                   visiting the various departments in SAP, I recall an employee explaining how the way to success isn’t based off of the number 
                                   of A’s or B’s one gets, rather it’s the result of one’s determination and effort applied into their education. Also, I gained 
                                   some helpful tips towards becoming a computer software engineer such as starting internships and opening clubs to get a better 
                                   understanding of the work criteria along with building leadership skills which will help communicate with others. Likewise, I
                                   learned about the fundamentals SAP focuses upon with regard to the different areas in business such as marketing, engineering, 
                                   processing, food industry, etc. With that being said, this field trip is quite important and memorable due to the welcoming hosts 
                                   along with the knowledge obtained.

                                   the most influential presentation was the “Professional Engineering Licensing with Emphasis on Civil Engineering” by Dan Cherner 
                                   and Natalina Dernarai. The overall concepts being discussed were based on the steps to get into the civil engineering pathway along
                                   with some facts related towards the history of this particular job. In addition, I want to become a computer software engineer 
                                   and what I found quite intriguing in this presentation was that the presenters took into account of all the possible jobs and spoke
                                   about engineering as a whole. In other words, Dan and Natalina didn’t only go over the civil engineering aspect, they included facts
                                   about what makes a good engineer in terms of being responsible, independent, and determined. Also, what I found quite inspiring 
                                   regarding this specific career is the way buildings are made with regard to the correct proportion required because if the building 
                                   isn’t equally balanced, it simply collapses which wastes time, money, and the effort spent on it. Another factor to consider is that in order for projects to 
                                   function in the civil engineering field, there needs to be a civil, mechanical, along with an electrical engineer present at all times.</h2>

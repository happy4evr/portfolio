                                  Throughout the journey of becoming a computer software engineer, I am attempting to gain work experience, knowledge, and skills
                                in order to prepare for the base of foundation preffered at various companies. In addition, I have attended a variety of events such as the 
                                SAP Field Trip, GTGTC events, etc which have continued to expand my desire to work in the computer software field. At Dublin High School, there are various oppurtunities
                                which contribute to gaining information such as the field trips, events, along with the internships and programs. With that being said, I am currently 
                                a work-in-progress as per the status of my diploma with the intention of majoring in computer science and software. <a href = "Images/Resume-KS (5).pdf" target="_blank" id='aloha8' >

                                   Throughout the field trips I have attended, one that stood out the most was my trip to SAP, which was quite 
                                   intriguing in terms other employees sharing their experience towards becomes successful in life. While visiting 
                                   the various departments in SAP, I recall an employee explaining how the way to success isn’t based off of the
                                   number of A’s or B’s one gets, rather it’s the result of one’s determination and effort applied into their
                                   education. Also, I gained some helpful tips towards becoming a computer software engineer such as starting 
                                   internships and opening clubs to get a better understanding of the work criteria along with building leadership 
                                   skills which will help communicate with others. Likewise, I learned about the fundamentals SAP focuses upon with
                                   regard to the different areas in business such as marketing, engineering, processing, food industry, etc.
                                   With that being said, this field trip is quite important and memorable due to the welcoming hosts along with
                                   the knowledge obtained.

                                   Accordingly, when taken into consideration of all the guest speakers, the most influential presentation was the “Professional Engineering Licensing with Emphasis on Civil Engineering” by Dan Cherner 
                                   and Natalina Dernarai. The overall concepts being discussed were based on the steps to get into the civil engineering pathway along
                                   with some facts related towards the history of this particular job. In addition, I want to become a computer software engineer 
                                   and what I found quite intriguing in this presentation was that the presenters took into account of all the possible jobs and spoke
                                   about engineering as a whole. In other words, Dan and Natalina didn’t only go over the civil engineering aspect, they included facts
                                   about what makes a good engineer in terms of being responsible, independent, and determined. Also, what I found quite inspiring 
                                   regarding this specific career is the way buildings are made with regard to the correct proportion required because if the building 
                                   isn’t equally balanced, it simply collapses which wastes time, money, and the effort spent on it. Another factor to consider is that in order for projects to 
                                   function in the civil engineering field, there needs to be a civil, mechanical, along with an electrical engineer present at all times.
